📌 Project Overview

Reflex Arena is a browser-based, real-time reaction game built using core JavaScript concepts.
The project focuses on creating an interactive system where users must make quick and accurate decisions based on changing visual rules.

The objective of the project is to demonstrate practical understanding of:

DOM manipulation
Event-driven programming
Timer-based logic
State management
UI/UX considerations in interactive systems
No external libraries or frameworks have been used.

🧠 Problem Statement

Reaction-based digital systems require users to respond accurately under time pressure.
When rules change dynamically, users often lose focus, leading to incorrect decisions and reduced engagement.

This project aims to:
Test both reaction speed and decision accuracy
Maintain continuous user focus
Provide immediate visual and logical feedback
Ensure clean state transitions in real time

🎮 How the Game Works

A target color is displayed to the user.
Colored circles appear randomly inside the game arena.
The user must click only the circle matching the target color.
Clicking the wrong color or missing a circle results in a penalty.
The game runs for a fixed duration and increases difficulty over time.
At the end, a Game Over panel displays performance metrics.

⚙️ Key Features

Real-time score tracking
Accuracy percentage calculation
Dynamic difficulty progression
Visual target indication
Clean game restart without page reload

In-arena game over summary (no overlays)

🧩 JavaScript Concepts Used

DOM Manipulation
Dynamic creation and removal of elements
Event Handling
Click events on dynamically generated elements
Timers
setInterval for game flow and spawning
setTimeout for element lifetime control
State Management
Score, time, accuracy, target color, difficulty
Conditional Logic
Scoring, penalties, and performance evaluation

🎨 UI & UX Considerations

Persistent target color display to maintain focus
Clear visual hierarchy for score, accuracy, and time
Minimal but readable neon-themed interface
Game Over panel placed inside the arena to avoid UI layering issues
Immediate feedback for correct and incorrect actions

🛠️ Challenges Faced

Managing multiple states simultaneously (score, time, accuracy)
Handling clean game restarts without UI glitches
Avoiding overlay and z-index related issues
Simplifying UI logic to ensure stability and reliability
These challenges were resolved through iterative debugging and refactoring.

📈 Future Enhancements

Difficulty selection modes (Easy / Medium / Hard)
Keyboard-based interactions
Improved animations and visual feedback
High-score persistence using localStorage

📝 Reflection

This project helped me move from writing isolated JavaScript logic to thinking in terms of systems, states, and user experience.
It strengthened my understanding of event-driven programming and real-time UI updates, and improved my confidence in building complete frontend applications using core JavaScript concepts.

▶️ How to Run the Project

Clone or download the project files.
Open index.html in any modern web browser.

No additional setup is required.

✅ Conclusion

Reflex Arena demonstrates the practical application of JavaScript fundamentals in building an engaging, real-time interactive system.
The project emphasizes clarity, reliability, and user experience while remaining fully aligned with the course syllabus.

🔒 Final Note

This project was built incrementally with a focus on understanding concepts rather than adding unnecessary complexity.
